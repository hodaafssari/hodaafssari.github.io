<h2>Golden Hour</h2>

<p> She’s the golden hour,
<br>
She’s the sun in the silver sky,
<br>
She’s my wind, she’s my light,
<br>
But one day the sun will fly.
<br>
<br>

It’ll be a rain of memories and burdens,
<br>
The golden hour will be gone,
<br>
Because Heaven will flee behind the curtain of pearls.
<br>
<br>
There will be nothing to gaze at,
<br>
But the sky won’t be dark,
<br>
It’ll simply not be there.
<br>
