<h2>Net Art</h2>

<p>I decided to create a series of pages around a poem that a friend wrote about me for this Net Art assignment. Each page will be a line from the poem and include a corresponding image. </p>

<p>This is the author of the poem, my friend: 
Fatema B.  </p>
<br>
<img src="fatema.jpg" alt="fatema"  style="width:756px;height:1008px;">

<p>p.s: I purposely chose this picture to embarrass her but also show off her amazing eyes. </p>
<br><br>
This is the topic of the poem, me: Hoda A.
